This is my checklist for how to implement the webscraper

python -m src.scraper to run scraper from root directory


Current step: change 
    def saveRawBlocketData(listOfBlocketPages):  doesnt scrape correct data


Next step: use blocket urls to scrape website and parse important data such as 

    Title
    Price
    Location
    Link to the listing
    Any other details you want

Next step: parse raw data
Next step: Start creating the database
Next step: Move parsed data to the sqlite database
